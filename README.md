# diaryx_sync_extism

Extism guest plugin wrapping `diaryx_sync` for on-demand CRDT sync.

## Overview

This crate compiles to a `.wasm` module that can be loaded by the Extism host runtime:
- **Native** (Tauri/CLI): via `diaryx_extism` (wasmtime)
- **Web**: via `@extism/extism` JS SDK

The plugin owns all CRDT state (WorkspaceCrdt, BodyDocManager) in its own WASM sandbox and is loaded on demand when sync is enabled.

## Exports

### JSON (standard Extism protocol)

| Export | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `manifest()` | Plugin metadata + UI contributions (sync settings, Share/Snapshots/History tabs, status bar) |
| `init(params)` | Initialize with workspace config |
| `shutdown()` | Persist state and clean up |
| `handle_command(request)` | Structured commands (CRDT ops, sync state, etc.) |
| `on_event(event)` | Filesystem events from the host |
| `get_config()` / `set_config()` | Plugin configuration |

### Binary (hot path)

| Export | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `handle_binary_message(bytes)` | Framed v2 sync message, returns action envelope |
| `handle_text_message(text)` | Control/handshake messages, returns action envelope |
| `on_connected(params)` | Connection established, returns initial sync messages |
| `on_disconnected()` | Connection lost |
| `queue_local_update(params)` | Local CRDT change, returns sync messages to send |
| `on_snapshot_imported()` | Snapshot downloaded and imported |
| `sync_body_files(params)` | Request body sync for specific files |

## Host Functions Required

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `host_log` | Log a message |
| `host_read_file` | Read a workspace file |
| `host_list_files` | List files under a prefix |
| `host_file_exists` | Check file existence |
| `host_write_file` | Write a text file |
| `host_delete_file` | Delete a file |
| `host_write_binary` | Write a binary file |
| `host_emit_event` | Emit sync events to host |
| `host_storage_get` | Load persisted CRDT state |
| `host_storage_set` | Persist CRDT state |
| `host_get_timestamp` | Get current timestamp |
| `host_ws_request` | Optional forward-compatible websocket bridge (currently host-owned transport path uses stub/no-op) |

All host functions use the Extism string ABI (`String -> String`), so side-effect
functions should still return an empty string (`""`) from the host.

State access inside the guest uses non-panicking `try_borrow`/`try_borrow_mut`
paths for both binary hot-path handlers and JSON/lifecycle exports
(`init`/`shutdown`/`handle_command`/`on_event`/`get_config`/`set_config`), so
transient borrow conflicts are surfaced as warnings/errors instead of crashing
the plugin with `RefCell` borrow panics.

## Build

```bash
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown -p diaryx_sync_extism --release
# Output: target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/diaryx_sync_extism.wasm

# Optional optimization:
wasm-opt -Oz target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/diaryx_sync_extism.wasm -o dist/diaryx_sync.wasm
```

Or via the build script which includes this step:
```bash
./scripts/build-wasm.sh
```

If browser loading fails with unresolved `__wbindgen_*` imports, the served
`apps/web/public/plugins/diaryx_sync.wasm` file is stale or incorrect. Re-run
`./scripts/build-wasm.sh` so the Extism guest artifact from this crate is copied
to `public/plugins`.

## Binary Action Envelope

Binary exports return an action list encoded as:
```
[u16: num_actions]
for each action:
  [u8: action_type]   // 0=SendBinary, 1=SendText, 2=EmitEvent, 3=DownloadSnapshot
  [u32: payload_len]
  [payload_bytes]
```
